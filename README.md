Notes:

- For the morse code in main.c, the bounds for character time were adjusted to 500 ms threshold 
  between dot and dash and 1000 ms for space since the originals were too short to be tapped out 
  manually with consistency.
- Need to comment out partb.c if trying to run main. If trying to run partb.c, need to comment
  out the task-specific contents of main.c and call partb() in the main method of the main.c file.
