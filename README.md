Notes:

- For the morse code in main.c, the upper bound for dot time, upper/lower bounds for dash time,
  and lower bound for new character time were doubled (from those suggested in the lab document),
  since the originals were too short to be tapped out manually with consistency.
- Please comment out partb.c if trying to run main. If trying to run partb.c, comment out the
  contents of main and call partb() in the main method.
